I met a guy and one thing led to another and I began using with him. First smoking crack then snorting heroin. Then shooting up both heroin and cocaine. This lasted about two years. In those two years my relationship with my boyfriend began to become abusive. I left my home to live with him.  We were homeless for a long period of time.  I've slept in backyards on benches and in the woods. Then the in and out of jail began. For about a Year that's all it was. Until one day I got arrested again and decided to go away to a rehab program called dynamic youth community in upstate new york. I went there for almost 3 years.  Inpatient and outpatient. I eventually started school for substance abuse to earn my CASAC certificate in the state of New York.  Then I began working as an actual counselor in the rehab I was in. I completed my program after three years and then eventually moved back home to NJ. I have been clean off heroin cocaine and crack for almost 10 years. It will be 10 years in September 2014. I am now married own my own home and am expecting a baby any day. I am striving to open up my own rehab center to give back to addicts like myself. It's important to give back and keep things in front of you. I have been through hell in my life while using. Assaults abuse homelessness and almost death. But I honestly wouldn't change any day of it. I wouldn't be the woman I am today if it wasn't for what I've been through. I met people in rehab that taught me how to be any human being again.

", "gender": "Female"}, {"town": "Middlesex", "category": "recovery", "story": "I started using heroin when I was 19 and my first reaction when I was offered it was who even does herion? And as soon as I tried it I was instantly in love with how it made me feel. In high school I struggled with drinking too much and developed a cocaine addiction and was in my first rehab at 15. I never did pills before picking herion, I honestly didn't like how opiates made me feel. My herion addiction started off only on weekends and I was only sniffing it. On Thanksgiving i woke up extremely sick and thought I had the flu, later that night me and my boyfriend got heroin and all symptoms instantly went away. This is when I knew I had a problem, but it didn't stop me. The next 2 years I used everyday. My family didn't want to be around me and didn't trust me at all. I was living in a motel with my boyfriend and when I turned 21 me and him decided we needed help. I went to my own rehab and he went to his own. Going in I really wanted to stay clean and not use heroin ever again. Shortly after being in a 30 day rehab I was drinking all the time and snorting cocaine and molly. It didn't take long at all for me to start using heroin again. I lost my grandmother and I lost control. The Nevers I said I would never do happened . I was using a needle and using everyday. Then I was shooting heroin and molly everyday all day long. I ended up being caught at work and told I needed help, but I wasn't ready to get help yet. My boyfriend was being sentenced to jail and I was going to get help once he went away. I lived in a crack house with my boyfriend, I never had money for food so I lost a lot of weight. My family knew something was wrong because I never came around. I missed Christmas with my family which killed my mother. My nephew 3rd birthday party in Feb 2014 was where my family saw me after not seeing me for months. I showed up extremely high and extremely late. My twin sister was crushed and I only went there to manipulate her into giving me money. The next 2 weeks were hell, it wasn't fun anymore. My hole family didn't want me in their lives unless I got help. They gave me an intervention where they told me I had a bed in FLorida at a rehab. I said no and went back to my house with my boyfriend and layed there and asked myself what the hell are you doing, this is not the life you want! And i decided to go away. Feb 24th 2014, I went to Florida and I was determined to change my life. 2 weeks past and I wanted to leave because all I could think about was my boyfriend I left behind. I stuck it out and thank god I did because it changed my life, I found out underlying issues to why I was the way I was. Then I went to a halfway house and took every suggestion that was given to me. I am now 5 months clean and extremely greatful. I got a sponsor who I call everyday, I attend a NA meeting everyday and most of all I don't pick up. I never though my life would crumble to the bottom that it did. I hurt the closest people to me and didn't care about anyone. Everything I did was to get that next high. I was a terrible aunt to my two amazing nephews. Today I have my family back in my life who are proud of me. I'm a good daughter, sister, niece, and most of all I'm a better person. I never thought I could be happy, but today I am. My recovery comes before anything else in my life because if it doesn't it will take me back out. I know its not getting better out there and I never want the life I was living. I have my own apartment in FLorida with my best friend who I met in detox. I have an awesome support system down here. Bottom line you don't need to hit a bottom like everyone says, if you want this you can have it.  I still have bad days in recovery, but I don't pick up. I learned that I can have fun clean and aober which I never thought was possible. I'm not gunna preach like this is so easy and you'll be happy immediately because it doesn't work like that. This is the hardest thing I've done, and I still struggle with the thoughts and insanity in my head but I have people in my life to help me through it. As far as my relationship with the boyfriend who I used with and was with for 4 years, he is currently serving time in jail. Today I don't do everything I can to make everyone else happy, I work on me all day long. For new addicts who some advise I have is that if you think that by taking heroin out of the picture and that you can still drink please try it and let me know how it goes. Drinking took me right back out, I didn't do heroin right away but it didn't take long for me to have a needle in my arm like I never stopped. Don't stay with the same people you used with or the places, change is a big part in what keeps me clean. And if you don't think your an addict or you didn't hit your bottom because your not using a needle or you didn't use as much as someone else that's bull because everyones stories are different but we all share a common bond that our lives have became unmanageable, its when your sick and tired of literally being sick and tired. Get a sponsor and work the 12 steps. I promise that it is worth it to stick around because amazing things happen.

We had saved up change for 4 yrs and 1 night noticed that all our change was gone, approx. $1500/$2000. We kicked him out. He denied stealing it, begged to let him move back in. Our answer was no. \nA couple wks later, our business van's window was broken into and rolls of electrical wire taken. Police were called and we saw a video tape of our son, selling our wire to a scrapyard. There is now a warrant out for his arrest.

He is a liar, a thief, a manipulator, and he is very good at all of these. \nUnless he admits he is a drug addict, we now know there isn't anything we can do. We can only hope he gets the help he needs before he dies of his addiction. \nHe has told us it would be our fault, when your son is dead. We called the police, one time when he texted us this, thinking that he would now get help. The police took him to the hospital, he was evaluated, blood work done. They knew by his blood work that he was using, but did not find any mental illness, and discharged him.

We have taken him to the emergency room, bc we could not wake him up, and when our son tells them he is in pain, they prescribe opiates. ??? Why, why when we tell them he is an addict?

Finding any way to get money so that I don't have to be sick by the afternoon. I've been addicted to heroin for well over 10 years with sobriety periods that ranged from a few months to over a year. I lost everything I was about to lose my family when it clicked that I don't want to be doing this anymore. I want my life back I want to be happy and healthy. I stole from my mom from work something I never thought I would do I did. I lost my job (actually happy about that) but I never lost my family. See in my house all three kids were heroin addicts. We were raised middle class had values were taught to hold the doors for others and all ways say please and thank you. We weren't street kids with parents that didn't care in fact they care to much at times never wanting to see us fall and that can hinder a drug addict. Let us fall let us get to the point were the options are death or jail and most likely you won't go to jail. See in Camden the cops don't go after the dealers they go after the buyers take the drugs and if they want to write you a ticket or take you to jail they will but 9 out of 10 times they just tell you to leave and take your drugs. See i didn't fit the mold of a drug addict so when I was pulled over by them they just let me go and so many times I wanted them to take me away so I could get help. I don't have health insurance so I can't afford to get help unless I am in legal trouble what bullshit is that. Last year my parents paid for my younger brother out of pocket to go to rehab only to get and use again. He is a habitual relapser going to a rehab getting out and using. My older brother his wife gave him an ultimatum get help or we get divorced even though they just got married. He has been clean from opiates for a few years now. My younger brother just went to another detox/ rehab last week. Will it work this time who knows it's his 8th or 9th time going and he is only 24 years old. For me I have been clean again for 3 weeks I left myself with no money no gas and stuck it out until I was able to see a suboxone therapist a week later. In the mean time I was sick as a dog but realized that this was it the last FUCKING TIME I SWEAR TO GOD I AM DONE. I want my family more then I want the drug. The cops in Camden need to grow some fucking balls and go after the dealers instead of the buyers. Ok so you may get 10 bags off of a person but the dealers are holding it in houses they buy on a street they set up for drug operations all ways having thousands of bags in those houses at any time. But no the cops are told not to bother with them in case they are holding guns. See down here the guys setting up the sets aren't getting kids to sell there drugs they are getting drug addicts to sell the drugs in exchange for a few bags and some money. Ok so they put cops on foot patrol in Camden but only on a few streets and doesn't matter people are still selling and now PCP is a big thing for the dealers themselves to use and other black people that live in Camden walk down. Mt. Ephriam Ave. and you will see people all over lighting up a cigarette laced with PCP with a cop standing right there. They rave about all the cops they have out in Camden doing foot patrol and making a difference but that's bull shit they go after the guppy instead of the shark. So drugs will all ways be  in Camden until they grow some balls and do something. My story is the same as everyone else's it started off with prescription drugs and ended with heroin. Will this be my last time ever using it again I don't know but all I can do is live one day at a time appreciate what life has to offer. Life really isn't that bad ok so I used so I didn't have to deal with life and the issues I have dealt with in my life but in the end life is far more better without drugs. So maybe this will be my last time I'm hoping and I pray everyday the urge to use has gone away but it can all ways come back its a life long issue. Now only they offered free help to people like me therapy and suboxon treatment but there is to much money to be made off of it plus most doctors don't go through the insurance companies.

Underage drinking was very acceptable and seemed the norm. Parents provided alcohol without hesitation. Alcohol turned to marijuana to cocaine and eventually to heroin. \n\nI wasn't your \"typical\" junkie. I worked full-time. My friends were not users. On the outside, everything looked good. But I held a dark secret, I was a heroin addict. Those closest to me were aware, but most did not have any idea. Although I worked full-time, I did not not have benefits. When I found out I was pregnant, I was told in order to keep my baby, I would have to quit my job in order to be eligible for Medicaid and assistance which would guarantee me a bed for treatment. Treatment allowed me to receive help and allow someone to oversee me and a new baby. This is treatment which I had been seeking for years, but noone would take me: single, no benefits and working. Now that I was pregnant, things were different. Our state takes care of children. This is the only reason I received treatment. But for this I was grateful. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I have since graduated community college, am transferring to a four year university. I am slowly rebuilding my life. And my daughter can have a life that does not included a drug addicted mother. It has not been easy by any means. Government assistance is not the \"hand-out\" that people believe it to be.

Once her addiction took hold, we saw my sweet, beautiful, sensible, caring and intelligent daughter transform into this completely different person. She became a sickly, disheveled, lying, lazy stranger. She seemed to sleep most days away, slowly losing interest in everything she had previously cared about. She lost her job, quit school and was basically killing herself right in front of our eyes. Our fears and concern for her led to some very ugly family scenes. Our lack of understanding only helped to enable and eventually accelerate her downward spiral. My own life had become insane. My physical and emotional health began to rapidly deteriorate.\n\nThe real  turning point for us was the discovery that she had been systematically stealing from every member of our family including my elderly mom who had come to live with us. These events led to the beginning of her detox and rehab journey as well as my own recovery with the assistance of a local Naranon support group. The next six months were filled with insurance battles, attempts at outpatient (IOP) treatment, creation of healthy boundaries, relapses, a week of homelessness on the streets of NJ, a brief inpatient stay (which insurance would not cover), followed by PHP (partial hospitalization) and more IOP services. Finally, by January of 2013, it became obvious that if my daughter stayed home none of us would ever be well again. \n\nThrough a recommendation she received from a counselor at her last IOP,  she was given the number of an outreach program called Steps to Recovery. With the help of this program she was placed in a rehab facility in Florida. This advocacy group negotiated with our insurance company and gained their reluctant approval. The rehab facility (Ocean Breeze Recovery) agreed to accept whatever our insurance would pay and scholarship the remaining cost of her stay. Over the course of the next year, she continued her battle with addiction having multiple relapses followed by quick returns to sobriety. Her last relapse almost caused her her life after shooting heroin laced with fentanyl. I can honestly say that I could not have survived all of this trauma without the support of my friends at Naranon.\n\nAt this time, my daughter is living in a three quarter sober house, working a full-time job, and actively participating in a twelve step program with the help of her Sponsor. She recently celebrated six months of sobriety and is working hard to get her entire life back on track realizing that she has a lifelong battle ahead of her. I feel that a new and improved version of my \"real\" daughter has been returned to our family. At this time, I am truly hopeful for her future. However, I continue to attend my weekly support meetings understanding how fragile both of our recoveries are. \n\nWith the help of my Naranon groups, and their literature, I have learned to \u201cdetach with love\u201d, allowing my daughter to figure out her own life. I realized that all of my \"help\" had really just prolonged her disease and that by getting out of the way I have shown my daughter that I believe in her ability to manage her own life. I can honestly say that I have found serenity and gratitude as a result. My relationship with my addicted daughter is now based on mutual respect and understanding.

This was very different from where he grew up in rural Colts Neck.  He had lost his job, his car and had received a 5-year probation for a crime committed to support his heroin habit.  The experience humbled him.  He was getting in touch with his spiritual side and was seeking God.  We all believed he had finally hit bottom and would now start getting up.  He was making a lot of progress.  In hindsight, too much progress in too short a time.  He found a job at a local gym as a membership consultant, where he quickly made sales quota.  He was able to finance a used car and was offered the position of house manager at the new sober living house he was moving to which is owned by the same owner of the house in Trenton.  This was to take place on the first week of February.\n\nAll these responsibilities at once for someone who was only 3 months into recovery was too much for him to handle.  He felt pressured.  According to texts found on his phone, sometime around February 4 or 5 he relapsed.  On February 11 he was evicted from the sober living house for using drugs.  On that day, he asked if he could spend the night at my house.  He did not tell me that he had been evicted or that he had relapsed.  His reason for spending the night was that my house was closer to his job than his new house in Lambertville.  When he came over we discussed his new endeavors and he told me that he had decided not to take the manager\u2019s job at the house as he felt it was too much too handle.  Probably the only truth he told that night, \u201cthat it was too much to handle.\u201d  He kissed me good night, told me he loved me and went to bed.  The next morning my son was dead from an apparent heroin overdose (as of this writing, I have not received a toxicology report\u2026a needle and a baggie were found near his body).  \n\nThat same day of my son\u2019s death, I went to the sober living house where he had been staying to get answers.   I wanted to know why I was not informed that my son had been evicted.  Why no one had been called:  not his probation officer, not the man from Christian Life Prison and Recovery Ministry who had paid his first month\u2019s rent, nor me.  The answer I received left me flabbergasted.  I was told that my son was a grown man and had made his own decisions.  \n\nI then realized that the system is broken.  These kids are left to fend for themselves and deal with a problem that is beyond their capabilities to handle.  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, addiction is \u201ca chronic, relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences. It is considered a brain disease because drugs change the brain; they change its structure and how it works. These brain changes can be long lasting and can lead to many harmful, often self-destructive, behaviors...The chronic nature of the disease means that relapsing to drug abuse is not only possible but also likely.\"  Therefore, how can he then be held to his decision not to go rehab, if his brain is damaged and not capable of making logical, sensical decisions.\n\nNJ needs a Substance Abuse Intervention Law that will allow parents, relatives and/or friends to petition the court for treatment on behalf of the person who is substance abuse impaired.  This law exists in Kentucky, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts and is being considered in Indiana. Denial and distorted thinking impedes and addict to make rational decisions. A heroin addict is only a needle away from death.  This disease is a progressive, life-threatening disease. The best hope of survival for a person who is substance abuse impaired is intervention. \n\nStudies show that involuntary treatment has the same success rate as voluntary treatment. In fact, many recovering addicts who are living a drug-free life today rare doing so thanks to a court-ordered treatment they received after having been arrested for a crime while under the influence of a substance. More often than not, drugs and crime go hand in hand since many addicts resort to crime to support their addiction. Court-ordered treatment has been proven to be effective regardless of who initiates it.\n\nHad this law been in place in NJ, the sober living house manager where Nick was living would have been compelled to use it on my son and he would be alive today.  Drug addiction is a hard disease to beat, but not an impossible disease to beat.  There are countless of success stories of people who suffer from a substance abuse disorder who are now living a drug-free life.  Many had relapsed numerous times.  For some it only takes one visit to a rehab center.  For others it may take countless visits.  But as long as they are alive, there\u2019s always hope that the next time in rehab will be the time they get it.\n", "name": "Alba", "timestamp": "7/28/2014 9:28:31", "age": "51", "quote": "He kissed me good night, told me he loved me and went to bed.

When I entered my freshman year at highschool I had already dabbled in various drugs, from pot to heroin. By the middle of my highschool career I was living s double life. Playing the role of a student, daughter, friend. Deep down I was seriously conflicted and injecting heroin in secrecy. I became totally removed from all activities school related. All of my \"friends\" were now those that shared our mutual Interest; heroin. Daily trips to areas such as east orange, Newark, Paterson became nothing of the norm. Reality was a white well respected family and parents were my background and I had no other reason than to fuel my addiction. So this lasted throughout highschool , junior year was my first impatient program. From 16-19 I had been in 5 inpatient rehabs, two private 3 state facilities. I became even more angry and frustrated and upon my release each time was not ready or could find the desire to stop using as they say. It wasn't until I lost all connections with my family and true friends, being homeless and stealing to support my raving habit. I went to jail and I guess that was the beggining of the end.I was being tried as an adult having  graduated passed my juvinlle convictions. I was facing prison time and multiple felony offense s due to my out of control lifestyle. With the guiding support of my family I was given one final chance to pull it together. My loving father who is also a recovering alcoholic, put up my bail money and I returned to the house I grew up in being away for 2.5 years. Not before I was sentenced my codefendant, who was also my boyfriend and best friend for 5 years agreed to take drug court as his plee. He was staying in a three quarter house in his hometown, in my opinion a terrible place to return. Unless you give it your 110% people places and things are what bring you back. Just before I was sentenced on Feb 8 2008 Louis Petrocco died. He attended drug court earlier that day and had what he called \"a 4 day window \" where he felt he could use on Thursday and attend probation Monday to look clean. He didn't make it and was found Friday morning by a family friend. He was 23 years old. I have lost many people to this terrible disease over the years. It is a vicious and terrible cycle to break. Luckily I am one of the miracles. After his death I remained sober for an entire 4 years. I relocated to California and I'm blessed with a beautiful, restored life. I have not done opiates since 2008, and I know it does not justify because in the program they say \"a drug is a drug is a drug\". However I disagree. I believe heroin and opiates are the worst of them. Physically controlling and slowly killing so many people. I am a California resident and do have a 215 card. I prefer this than my prescription of xanax doctors prescribed for my social anxiety. Either way I am able to say I survived the grief, hell, pain and ultimately life taking abuse of heroin. I thank god and am grateful to be a survivor and Stive on. Yes there are not enough treatment centers in nj. Yes there should be some more awareness thought to the youth about addiction.

I have been working out in the gym since I was 13 years old. 3 years ago I suffered an injury while working out. I tore 3/4 of my pectoral muscle off of my shoulder. Being in so much pain, I didn't know what to do. My mother took me to her doctor, which was a pain management doctor. The first day I walked in the door of that doctors office I was prescribed 10mg Percocet to take once a day for pain. The thing is, my addiction didn't really start here at pain management. It started in my mothers bedroom. 6 years ago my mother was involved in a car accident and hurt her neck. She was prescribed 10mg of Percocet twice a day for pain at the time from the same doctor I eventually went to. I really don't know what made me do it, but I found her pill bottle just sitting on her nightstand and I knew what Percocet was but I rarely ever had it. That day is where my addiction started and the fight for my life began. I took 2 10mg Percocets and laid in bed, ironically watching Intervention on A&E. 10 minutes go by and I feel like I'm floating on a cloud. I can't describe how good I felt in words. Oddly enough at that point in time my life didn't spiral out of control. I still held a job and a normal life thinking I am just using this drug recreationally.. What's the harm right? Well after spending time in physical therapy and being prescribed more and more Percocet from pain management a month, at the age of 24 years old I was a full blown opiate addict. I found myself taking up to 300mg of oxycodone a day. I was even hospitalized because I almost overdosed. That was when it hit me. I needed to do something about this and gain control of my life.

My first experiment was with my cousin taking Oxycontin pills. When that became too expensive we searched for alternatives, and after research we discovered Heroin. We began to sniff Heroin infrequently, and the frequency began to build over time until it was multiple times a week. It started to become a slight burden financially, but I was still able to hide it from my family.  When I was 22 I discovered the method of injection through my same cousin, and that became my preferred method of ingestion. After I graduated college (Bachelors degree), it all went downhill. For the next 6 months the needle became my closest friend, and my greatest enemy.  It began to spiral out of control when I first ran out of money and became extremely sick. The sickness stuns you initially, because no one tells you the consequences of daily use. I fell into sickness without even knowing what was happening. My bank account was at $0, my credit cards were maxed out, and I began to steal from my job. This lasted a few months until I was caught, and subsequently fired.  I lied to everyone and anyone about what had happened, because no one would have ever suspected the kid who maintained excellent grades, a college graduate with perfect credit, a steady job, and payments on a brand new car would ever be experimenting with drugs and stealing from his job. This journey took me to being arrested and charged with DUI in Paterson, when I pulled to the side of the road because I began to fall asleep behind the wheel. I shutter to think about what would have happened if I fell asleep while I was driving and couldn't park my car in time. I could be facing vehicular manslaughter if I had hit someone. I awoke to an officer at my window because someone had called the police because someone was sleeping in a running vehicle. He conducted a field sobriety test and subsequently charged me with DUI. This didn't even stop me. I began to steal from my family members. Tablets, I-pods, jewelry, it was all fair game. A forged check along with the missing items was enough for my mother to finally make me answer the tough questions. I had to tell her I was addicted, and had no solutions to my problem. I desperately needed help. It was the single worst day of my life.  I was checked into a detox, followed by a rehab stint.  Upon release I continued to use on and off for another 7 months, until I decided enough was enough, and I was either going to Jail or going to die if I didn't stop this dangerous behavior. The one thing that made me stop was the hurt I saw on my mothers face. I could tell she wasn't looking at me like her son anymore, I had become a monster. The near overdosing, almost crashing my car, being charged with DUI, being fired from my job, none of that made me stop. The sheer look of sadness and anguish on my mothers face was what I needed to see, and it has forever kept me away from opiates. I conquered it, and I am currently doing great. I am back to being a productive member of society. I currently work 50 hours a week, haven't missed a day of work or used Heroin in 16 months. I have saved a ton of money and I'm back to practicing excellent financial habits. I also am back to maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, gym membership). I am back to being who I was pre-addiction, and I couldn't be happier. I want my story to be an inspiration to those out there currently suffering from what I went through, and I want them to know there IS a way out. I've seen how dark and hopeless opiate addiction can be, but I've also seen the rewards of persistence against this disease and how giving it a fighting chance can save one's life.

Me and my daughter were close since we didn't have much family. In high school she had a few operations and was diagnosed with ovarian cysts she was also becoming rebellious and hanging out with the party crowd. I was a strict and loving but at times it was just hard to handle. She moved in with her dad around 19 and I moved away and that is when my life changed. I found out she had been using opiates for a while and now using heroin. I detoxed the first time alone fighting w her while she told me she was never going to stop using and that she didn't care if she lived or died. After 3 weeks she was my daughter again. That lasted a few months and she was hanging out with a bad crowd and back using. I was in Florida at the time and flew her down, when she got off the plane I was just do happy and relieved to have her with me but could see she just didn't care about herself and she was high, she passed out the whole ride while I wept while driving. She and I did it alone again, she didn't want to go anywhere and had gotten suboxone from a doctor. She got sober and wanted to ho back. I fought it hard but she got the ticket and I couldn't stop her. Once home she got into a relationship w a 41 yr olld controlling alcoholic. I was again depressed and knew she deserved better but could not convince her. A few months passed and she fell off the wagon and once again she came to my house and I begged her to get help and dropped her off at a so called friends house but not convinced I waited outside and she came back out and confirmed she was going to the hotel to shoot up.

I was born and raised in a great family in a nice house with everything I could ever dream of.. Then I met a boy.. He was from Washington Twp (Sewell) and was older. I had just started my first job, answering the phones at a pizza place and was 15. I slipped and fell one day, injuring myself and the hospital prescribed me Percocet. I didn't have insurance and couldn't afford to fill it. The boy, just happened to have some.. Little did I know where that was going to lead me. First I just took one orally. Then one day, weeks later (I had formed a habit and didn't even realize or understand it) there were no more left. The boy came to me with this powder. Told me it was just a crushed Percocet and that it did the same thing and wouldn't hurt me. He insisted it was safe and reminded me over and over that I was injured and needed it. That was the first day of the worse chapter in my life. I snorted that powder not knowing that I would end up with a 6 year life threatening addiction to heroin. That day, after I snorted that weird smelling, funny brown powder, I felt insane. I knew almost instantly that it wasn't what he said. I threw up, I cried, but for some reason I liked it. I didn't dare ask him about it, I had previously seen how angry he could get and was afraid. The next day I did it again and again. I lost my job, I dropped out of high school, I moved in with the boy. One day his friend came by when he wasn't home and asked if we needed anything from Camden, since he was already going. I laughed and said \"what the hell could we possibly need from Camden?\" That is when I really realized I was addicted to heroin. The friend laughed as well and said \"your joking right? Don't you do dope with him?\" I informed him that I only took Percocet and that it was for pain and he informed me that I was so dumb and since when did Percocet come in a blue was paper Baggie? I confronted the boy only to be hit with the truth. That I was in fact doing heroin. I packed up and went home to my dad and brother, then the withdraw kicked in. I literally felt like I was going to die. I was hurting I was scared and I was alone. I didn't want to ask my family for help because my pride wouldn't allow me to let them down. I went back to the boy, got a fix, cried some more and realized that I was never going to amount to anything and I gave up on myself. In the years to follow I started using IV. I was in and out of jail, and hospitals due to stealing and overdoses. I died once and my family finally found out was going on. They fought for me, they put me in rehab over and over and it just didn't work. I stole from them, from strangers, from stores and just kept getting deeper and deeper into my addiction. I did things I swore I would never do just to get that next bag. I was held at gunpoint in Camden twice. I got caught at a dope set in Camden by a SWAT team and still that wasn't enough to scare me away. The heroin had a hold of me. I was pale, malnourished, underweight, and depressed. I was mentally, psychically, and sexually abused on a daily basis til one day I decided that I had had enough. One of my trips to rehab I had met someone from NA that lived in Allentown, PA. I called them and begged for help. Another member of NA from nj drove me out there where I detoxed on the woman's couch. It was horrible. I was so so sick I couldn't get up for days. But I had had enough and I wasn't going to give in. I stuck it out and to this day I am still clean. The day I decided to change was April 10th 2007. Seven years. Seven years I have been clean! I thank god every single day for giving me the courage and strength to get clean. Since getting clean I have worked the steps of NA, I have given my story at a podium in front of thousands of people at an NA convention in PA, NJ, and FL. I volunteered at rehabs and I got my life back. Today, I am married with two beautiful little girls and two college degrees. I am one in a million and I am proud.

I\u2019m from a small town in Jersey and drugs were always accessible. It\u2019s not as much a characteristic of my hometown but the status of NJ\u2019s heroine and drug epidemic. \nWhen I was 17 someone very close to me passed away from heroine/opiate overdose. My life has never been the same. Perhaps I wasn\u2019t prepared to cope with such tragedy and depression but I don\u2019t know if anyone is. I\u2019m not sure how I went from coping with a loss to abusing drugs myself but it wasn\u2019t long before I was trapped by addiction. The very thing that stole a loved one my family was now killing me slowly. I dropped out of college, I isolated myself from my family and friends, I was no longer the smiling child with the world at his hands. I was just another deadbeat drug addict with every excuse in the world\u2026but I couldn\u2019t stop. It didn\u2019t matter how much I tried or how many times I swore to the high heavens that I would be clean and sober\u2026I could not get clean. There was nothing more I wanted than to be clean and a productive member of society. I thought I was doomed to overdose or find myself behind bars. I was drowning in a pool of my own misery with my family reaching their hands out to grab me but I couldn\u2019t find the strength to grab back. \n        If there\u2019s one thing I want readers with kids to take away from this is to never give up. Please, don\u2019t give up on your kids if they\u2019re trapped in addiction. They don\u2019t want what they have. Despite all my wrongdoing my family was there for me whenever I needed them\u2026.even when I was just a dead beat drug addict. My family and girlfriend never gave up on me even when I couldn\u2019t look at myself in the mirror. If it weren\u2019t for them, I may not of found the courage to come home after a binge and cry in their arms. I don\u2019t know where I finally found the courage\u2026I woke up after a 2 week binge of much I don\u2019t remember and ran home as fast as I could. I went to my mom in tears and screamed for help. The next day I was in a rehab facility on my way to recovery\u2026only it wasn\u2019t that easy. I would go on to relapse countless times and morphed back into a hopeless statistic of relapse. \n        After several failed attempts and multiple visits to drug rehab institutions something finally clicked. I don\u2019t know what it was but I can tell you the support and love from those who never gave up on me was possibly the only life left in me.\n         But a short time ago I lost another loved one to the vice of addiction. My roommate from rehab lost the battle and died from a heroine overdose. He was a special soul who helped me get clean. See, when you\u2019re struggling to get clean, as a college kid the hardest part is re-entering society. Peer-pressure is all around you, you\u2019ve forgot how to have fun without substances. I found strength and support in this friend; we were in this together. When I was informed of his passing, I was overwhelmed with pain immediately breaking down. A part of me died that day.\nI understand the stigma with those struggling from addiction. There was a time when I shared the same ideology. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion but this isn\u2019t a problem that\u2019s going away. We have countless neighbors, friends, and family members struggling in New Jersey. I\u2019m not suggesting we throw money at the problem\u2026.I don\u2019t know what the answer is, I would be foolish to claim I did. Addressing the heroine and addiction epidemic has no clear answers but its perception is clogged with misconceptions and ignorance. \nHeroine and pills ripped my life apart and stole people from my life and I commemorated their lives with my own path of destruction and addiction. But if it were not for the loved ones and strangers that stood by my side I wouldn\u2019t be here today. And today I\u2019m a college-graduate with a full-time job and I successfully ran for public office. I\u2019ve been terrified and ashamed to share my story until I came across this project the Star-Ledger is putting together.

I never thought in a million years it would be \"herion\". I always knew in the back of my mind if I could get it I would try it. My so called friend who was an older boy brought me to Paterson N.J. to get some coke one night and asked me if I wanted to try \"what he does\". I didn't even ask what it was I didn't care what it was, anything that would help me come down from the coke sounded good to me. From then on when we would go it was no more coke it was \" what he did\". It was like we couldn't say the word cause it was a horrible dirty word at least I knew it was a bad word. In the beginning I was on the top of the world and that fear and insecurity left me anytime I sniffed a bump. I hid for a long time in till stuff in my house came up missing. I would take anything my so called friend told me was worth any value. I ended up dropping out of school after a friend's suicide. After that my addition took off and it landed me in psych wourds then my first rehab. I felt dope sick for the first time in my life at 17 but I know that now but back then I just thought I felt weird I had no idea what or how I was feeling I just knew I was severely depressed and wanted to die. I got out after 30 long days. From then on it was the same thing the pysc wourds and rehabs were a revolving doors. The longest I could stay clean was 30 days when I was away somewhere. Paterson was so close it was hard not to go back. My depression got to a point where I hung a belt in my back yard and I would get high on herion on just stair at it wishing I had the guts to just get it over with. I put myself in horrible neighborhoods that a skinny white girl doesn't belong I would hang out with people I had no business hanging out with I looked and felt like the walking dead.  I didn't want to get clean cause I knew what I would have to do and that was get away from everything and everyone I know. I thank God I never had to sell my body for drugs but I did sell my soul. When your on herion people are like aren't you scared you might die or not wake up and I would think , duh that's the point happy people don't do herion and people who do have a death wish and for me I would rather die then go through 30 days of not sleeping and feeling everything and I mean everything. Water would hurt you when your sick. I was dope sick one day and just sick in general of getting kick out of my house taking showers in diner bathrooms and shooting up in some grimy places that I said to myself if there is a god that is the only thing that is gonna keep me clean I'm obviously not dieing. I would try to overdose on purpose and I always woke up or I would make the decision when I knew I had enough dope to kill me I would end up getting crappie dope. So I knew something was looking after me. Finally   after so much going to hell Aka Paterson and back I got an opportunity to go out to La to a free program called the Dream Center. It was a Christian year long program but I didn't care I knew I needed at least a year after all the damage I did to myself. It was a tough program but that was what I needed and it was an answered prayer cause I once said to my ex bf that I wish there was a place that I could get off drugs learn about the Bible and get a relationship with God and that program was exactly that in a nut shell. I ended up staying for 2 and a half years and became the women's House Supervisor.  I loved it I was able to help girls who came in the program who had the same problems I did and I was able to share my experiences of fear and insecurity with them and share that I came in the program kicking herion not knowing God and having no hope what so ever. I needed to help others in order to stay clean. I came home in 2012 and fell back a little and blamed it on N.J. and Paterson but what I needed to learn that it was neither it was me. It wasn't easy and it still can be a struggle if I make it but it can also be a blessing cause I get to help others and there are a lot of others who are addicted to herion. Back when I was 17 the word herion was foreign but now saying it is like nothing cause you hear about it all the time now in the news papers and out of people's mouths about themselves or there loved ones. IV been clean for sometime now. I made it about mind over matter sone people need programs and meetings I just need loving people in my life and the thought of how much I wanted to die on it and it helps. I'm pregnant now and have a new reason to live and going to have a baby in my life that will love me for me matter what I look like. God works in mysterious ways and I believed I lived through all that cause I was meant to be a mother.

A year went by with doing well, living a normal life until I noticed a big difference in our relationship. I would work late nights as a server and come home to a man passed out, figuring he was just sleeping every night. One night on my way home from work I called him a thousand of times and got no answer, so naturally I rushed home! When I got home I yelled his name...received no answer. I ran into my bedroom to find him with a sandwich half eaten hanging out of his mouth. Something told me to pull his sleeves up because he was wearing a sweatshirt, and of course I found track marks. I couldn't wake him at first until I slapped him in the face, which then woke him. The next day his family and I pushed for him to go to a rehab, which happened...but only for a couple of days. And this led to two more rehabs after that as well, that only lasted no more than a week. Finally, his family and I called the police after finding him almost gone again and they admitted him to the Salem Memorial Hospital. Salem then admitted him to a facility that he could not sign himself out of without going to jail. Unfortunately, they didn't keep him long and when he got him he didn't stay clean for long. This was leading me to depression and loss of hope! My money was going missing and my family was falling apart, so I decided to pick up and move. The move was great the first two weeks, which we moved to PA. However, two weeks in...he relapsed! This time dangering my children.  Now he's looking to face 3 years in prison and losing his family for good. I never imagined ever having to go though this or having to pray for somebody's life everyday of my own. I hate addiction and what it's done to my love and family. Hopefully one day he won't have to deal with this demon, but for now it's an everyday struggle.  I understand partially but never will I understand how somebody could sell this drug knowing what it does to people.
